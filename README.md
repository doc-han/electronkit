# electronkit
This is a simple css framework just like bootstrap, semantic-ui and others out there, But what makes this special is the sense that it focuses on building desktop applications. Hence, component designs will be similar to the Windows ui design and if possible OSX too.

## Why?
This is a simple project to teach myself how to build a CSS framework from scratch.

## Tools
* Knowledge in CSS and SASS
* Grunt - Running Tasks(concatenating and watching files)
* Node-Sass - Compiling sass to css

## Contributions
Just make some PR's if you find some errors or want to add up.
